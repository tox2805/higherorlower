# Higher or lower card game
This python programme is an implementation of the Higher or Lower card game for Hawkeye Innovations take home task. Thank you for your time in reviewing my application!

## Usage
1) Navigate to this directory in a terminal
2) run the code: python higherorlower.py


## Implementation and future improvements
This project is a Higher or Lower Card Game implemented in Python using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It follows simple game mechanics where the player wins if they make 5 consecutive correct guesses (you can change this in line 231 if you're getting unlucky!).

If I had more time to work on this project, I would have liked to implement the following features:

1) Bonus game if the player finds a joker in the pack. The player needs to guess guess the suit color of the joker, earning additional points if correct or jokers could introduce a multiplier effect, doubling or tripling the player's score.
2) Dynamic difficulty. Implement scaling difficulty where the timeline length increases (e.g., guess seven cards in a row for advanced levels).
3) High score tracker. Save and display the player's highest scores across sessions using a local file or database.
4) Enchanced graphics. Visual animations for card flips and transitions between rounds.
